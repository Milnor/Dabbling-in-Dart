rapidly learn enough of a new language to land a job

## Installation
Installing binaries and setting up your development environment is non-trivial. There's a lot more to do than just `apt install` a compiler or interpreter and then knocking out code in `vim` or `VS Code`.
* **dart** - see the guide at [dart.dev](https://dart.dev/get-dart) which includes the commands for adding Google's GPG key
* **flutter** - instructions at [docs.flutter.dev](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux/android)
* **android studio** - directions provided at [developer.android.com](https://developer.android.com/studio/install#linux)
    - I unpacked the gzip file like this: `sudo tar -xf android-studio-2023.2.1.24-linux.tar.gz -C /usr/local`
        * root permissions needed to install to `/usr/local`
    - To launch, run `/usr/local/android-studio/bin/studio.sh`
